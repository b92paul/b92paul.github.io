// ANCHOR: the_future
I think it's important to have a future that is inspiring and appealing. I just think there have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Like, why do you want to live? What's the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? And if we're not out there, if the future does not include being out there among the stars and being a multiplanet species, I find that it's incredibly depressing if that's not the future that we're going to have., Elon Musk

// ANCHOR: wishful_thinking
I think one of the biggest mistakes people generally make and I'm guilty of too is wishful thinking. You know like, you want something to be true even if it isn't true. So you ignore the real truth because of what you want to be true. This is a very difficult trap to avoid and like I said certainly one that I find myself in having problems with. But if you just take that approach of you're always to some degree wrong and your goal is to be less wrong and solicit critical feedback, particularly from friends., Elon Musk

// ANCHOR: like-what-you-are-doing
Whatever you do, whatever area that you get into, even if you are the best of the best, there is always a chance of failure. So, I think it is important that you really like whatever you are doing.  
If you do not like it, life is too short.  
If you like what you are doing, you think about it even when you are not working. It is something that your mind is drawn to, and if you do not like it, you just cannot make it work., Elon Musk
